    I am a programmer who specialises in web based projects, having built website and web applications that have an impact on peoples lives. I also have a passion for business and love working with business owners to produce work that is profitable. Clean, minimalistic and functional design is the nature of my work in a nutshell. I believe the main aim of any design should be to guide users to their intended destination, not to confuse them.
