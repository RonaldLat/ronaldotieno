Starting a new blog is easy. But getting traffic is not.

Search Engine Optimization a very important aspect in blogging.
It is all the content you create and how you promote it. Without this, your blog will just get buried deep in the web.

It will take a few months for your blog to start getting meaningful amount of visitors and rank well on google search results. 

In this article I will show you how can accelerate the process. Remember it takes hard work and patience for results show. Act on this tips before, just learning about them is not going to enough.

There are two main ways to increase traffic to your new blog. Organic and Ad traffic. 
Organic traffic is free coming from search engines and backlinks while Ad traffic is the opposite. You pay for ad traffic to get your blog to be displayed as an advertisement. 
 
## Organic traffic

How can you boost traffic for your new blog with organic traffic?
Here are eight ways you can get free and unlimited amount of visitors to your new blog. 

#### 1. Do Keyword research

What is Keyword research? This is simply the process of finding popular search terms or phrases that users use on search engines. 

Keyword research should be taken more seriously as it will let you know which words readers use in order to find out more. 
This will make it easier for them to find your content.

Before writing any article, research these Keywords that are relevant to your topic. 
There are free tools that can help to find out the popular keywords for your topic such as Google Keyword Planner and Semrush.

### 2. Use Keywords

Doing Keyword research is one thing. But using them is what will get you results.

After discovering these keywords, sprinkle them through your blog post.
But importantly, use these keywords in important parts of your blog post like;
- Heading tag eg. **H1** .
- Sub-headings **H2**, **H3**
- Meta descriptions
- Paragraph tags
- Image Alt tags
- URLs
... just to mention a few.

Use keywords naturally and make them flow with your content. 

Don't overuse them as it will lower your articles quality. This the readers lose interest in your blog, resulting to low traffic. 

### 3. Build Links

#### Outbound Links

Using appropriate and relevant external and internal links can really help to boost your new blog's traffic. 

As you write your blog post, you can reference other external websites or blogs where more information can be found about what you are writing about for example and add that link to your post. 

Google or any other search engine robot will interprate this as a valuable piece of content and in return it will rank your blog higher. **Outbound linking** is the term used to refer to this action. 

#### Outbound Links

For **Inbound Links**, your blog links are published on other blogs or websites and hopefully the visitors of those external blogs/websites come to your blog through those links. 

Be careful with this tip though as it might do more harm than good to your blog. 
When google was new and it's bots were not well optimized, any blog or website that had a sizable number of backlinks ranked very well. 

But there was a problem with this algorithm. How relevant this links were was not checked and didn't matter. 

Smart people back then created hundreds or thousands of bot sites and spammed them with backlinks. Then BOOM! their sites or blogs ranked impressively. 

But Google engineers got smarter too and today the links are analyzed by the bots to check whether they are relevant. 
For exaple you are writing a blog about home bakery, what are the chances of your readers expecting to read about cars or politics on the same blog?

As you can tell, those topics are not relevant and Google might punish you for this by ranking your blog poorly. 
This is because Google's main aim is to provide the most relevant and high quality content when you make a search. 

### 4. Comment on other's blogs, with your blog link

When people do a search online, they are looking for answers or information. 
Providing more value to these people where less value is given can help your blog traffic increase.

For instance you are reading a blog post on how to lose weight. But you notice the author has left out a lot of valuable tips. 

If the blog has a comment section you can point out to what is missing from that post and add your link where other readers can click on to learn more about the additional tips. 

The key here is to add value before you get value. 
Make sure the information you are providing is value and relevant in the blog you are commenting on. It is not just asking for clicks for sake of it. 

If you do this, everyone will be winning. 
The blog's author will be thankful for you pointing out for the content that is lacking in his/her article. And hopefully the blog will get updated. 

The readers will get an opportunity to get more information about the topic they are interested in. And they will probably click on your link and read your article. 

Finally you will get more traffic to your blog.

Simply by giving others more value. Or answering questions they ask by giving them a link to your article which answers them, if in case you have covered the topic before.

### 5. Submit your blog to Google's Search Console

When a new a blog is published on the internet, it takes time for google spiders to crawl to it. 
Then it is indexed in the google's directory of sites available on the internet. 

After this is when it is dicoverable after doing a search on the search engine. 

At time this crawling process can be very lengthy. 
It can take anywhere from a few days, to two weeks or even more. 

To make things faster, you can submit your new blog to Google instead of waiting for it to find it naturally.

This is done by submitting your blog's url and sitemap to Google's Search Console. 
It will take time too for your site to get indexed even after doing this. But less time compared to not submitting.

### 6. Guest posting

Guest posting is writing for others blogs or blogging platforms.

You might be asking yourself "why would I be writing for other people while I got my own blog to worry about?". That is a good question. 

By writing for other established blogs or blogging platforms that receive a lot of traffic, you get a chance of letting you and your blog known to this existing audience.

When you write as a guest mention your blog. This will help you gain more reach. 

It is a win-win strategy as the foreign blogs receive free content and your in return get free traffic. 

Some of the guest posting platforms you might consider writing for are,
- [Dev.to](http://medium.com) - for programmers
- Medium

For blogs that are individually owned, you will have to reach out to them personally. 

Almost all blogs have contact section. You will either find a form you can fill or an email address. Even social media accounts can work.

Shoot them an email or message and make your proposal. It will be impossible for anyone to say no as there is nothing for them to lose but all to gain.

### 7. Promote your blog on social media

If you have a good amount of audience in your social media accounts you can take advantage of it by sharing with them your blog content. 

This will also work if you don't a large following to. 

You will join groups where the topic you write in your blog is being discussed. 
Then provide the group members with value information they seek and share with them your blog links only when it is relevant. 

Don't come off as spammy and pushy, with the only aim of getting clicks to your blog. 

People will notice this and they will avoid you. In some cases you might get kicked out of the group. 

With this strategy it is important to have the a genuine intention of helping or providing value to others, and the rest will follow. 

### 8. Create shareable content

One of the most interesting human behavior is to share with others what is thought to be useful, funny or whichever reason there is. 

That is why social media has become a big part of our lives. And one common thing among all social platforms is they let us *share*.

Now the question is, what do you create that is worth sharing?

Visual content grasp attention fast, are easy to consume and highly shareable. 
Don't panic because what I am going to suggest you start creating is not a video. 

**Infographics** is a great way of sharing information with your audience and getting backlinks. A whole blog post can be summarized in single infographic and don't forget to include your blog's link on it.

The image file can then be shared among your audience. Your reach will be boosted and people will come back to your website for more valuable content. 

You don't have to be a Pablo Picasso to crate great looking infographics.

There are free softwares such as [Canva](http://canva.com). With Canva you have access to hundreds of free templates to get you started with creating professional looking infographics without any design skills.

The best places to share infographics is where a lot of visual content is shared. Like Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

### 9. Write attention grabbing headlines

Your blog's article headline is like a sales pitch. You have to entice and convince your potential buyer to buy your product. 

The same is true with blogging. Users need to be assured that the link they are about to click will lead to the information they are looking for. 

What is a better way of convincing them to click on your link that to write a title that best describes the information they seek.

You can't depend on mediocre headlines to pitch your blog articles. 

You might have the best piece of content in the world. But if it sits behind a garbage headline, no one is going to find it. 


<subscribe > </subscribe>

### 9. Write evergreen articles

Some content become obsolete. Mostly like in niches like health, finance and relationship.

Write evergreen content today and years later it will still be relevant and people will search for and read your content. 

But a topic like today's football match event has a very low potential of attracting any significant traffic after a few weeks later, let alone months or years. 

### 10. Write within your niches

Sticking to your niche will let you establish authority. 

Authority is very important in google search results ranking. Blogs which command authority within a certain niche often rank better than those which don't. 

If you choose a particular niche, write only about it and it's sub-niches. Don't start writing about sports in one article, and recipes in the next. You won't be inspiring trust among your readers. 

Your readers should trust you. This will make them come back for more of your content. In return you will have a steady traffic on loyal readers.

## Ad traffic

Ad or Advertisement traffic is traffic you acquire by spending money. 

If you have a budget and want quick results, this is the way to go. I will list some of the best platforms to do your ad campaigns for a new blog.

### 1. Google Ads

No one beats Google in the search market. This makes them the number one search engine in the world based on the users they attract. 

This gives your advertisement high chances of being shown to the most relevant users. We all encounter Google Ads when we search for a term on google. And we can agree that that the ads are always related to what we are searching for. This makes them very likely to be clicked. 

That is the best thing about Google PPC. Ads are not just thrown around, but shown to relevant people.

### 2. Facebook Ads 

Promoting with Facebook is highly effective if you have a proper budget and know how to target your audience well.

In this method you can boost posts you have shared on Facebook so that it gets shown to many people who might be interested in it. 

Facebook Ads campaigns are very affordable and can fit into any budget. Make sure you promote only your best blog articles because you want to make a good first impression to your prospective readers.
